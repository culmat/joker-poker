Joker Poker

... is a distributed online [estimation poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) application crafted with ❤️.


**Features**

 * super easy to use - no fluff, just planning poker
 * no login, minimal setup - **[create a team](https://culmat.github.io/joker-poker/)** with a single click
 * optional [gravatar](gravatar.com/) and [monsterID](https://www.splitbrain.org/projects/monsterid) integration to make your poker session a friendly place
 * data privacy - in the spirit of [unhosted](https://unhosted.org/), Joker Poker is as *serverless* as possible
   * all data is only stored locally in each participants browser
   * Mozilla's open source [TogetherJS](https://github.com/mozilla/togetherjs) is only used for communciaton between participants browers (NAT traversal)
   * We use the instance [maintained by JSFiddle and hosted on glitch](https://github.com/jsfiddle/togetherjs/issues/1172). You can [check the source code](http://togetherjs-hub.glitch.me/server-source), [check it again](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/togetherjs-hub), or host your own service.
 * super simple and robust technology - it is really only one HTML and one Javascript file. No server side computing is done. You can save / host the page anywhere and it will work.
