Joker Poker

... is a distributed online [estimation poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) application crafted with ‚ù§Ô∏è.

**How it works**

There are two important screens ...

1) The ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-SVG/master/svg/account-multiple.svg) _Team_ screen shows all teammates and their votes, including yourself
1) The ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-SVG/master/svg/account.svg) _Me_ screen shows your vote and allows you to change it

and two important events ...

1) The _team starts voting_ - all votes are reset and hidden and all teammates are taken to the _Me_ screen
1) _All teammates have voted_ - all votes are revealed and all teammates are taken to the _Team_ screen, you can still change your vote
 
You can change between screens any time by clicking on your own vote or via the menu.
If any teammate presses _Restart_ the _team starts voting_.

To make sure JokerPoker correctly detects that _all teammates have voted_ ...

1) set yourself as _observer_ when you are not voting. You can do so from the ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-SVG/master/svg/cog.svg) _Settings_ screen or when joining a team
1) Disonnect yourself when away from the screen - your facilitator will rebuke you a little less üòè and it's only one click

**Questions & Answers**

 * JokerPoker is meant to be used on a secondary ( mobile ) screen. We assume you use other communication channels like voice and screen sharing in parrallel. You physical stimation poker cards don't show the topic either. [üòó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
